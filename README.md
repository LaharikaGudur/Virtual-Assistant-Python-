# Virtual-Assistant-Python-
This repository contains a simple Python-based virtual assistant program that uses text-to-speech (TTS) and speech recognition functionalities to interact with users. The assistant can greet users based on the time of day and respond to basic queries.

Features
1.Text-to-Speech (TTS): The program uses the pyttsx3 library to convert text to speech, allowing the assistant to communicate verbally with the user.
2.Speech Recognition: The program uses the speech_recognition library to listen to the user's voice commands and convert them into text for processing.
3.Dynamic Greetings: The assistant greets the user with a time-based message (Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good Evening).
4.Basic Commands: The assistant can respond to basic queries such as:
  "Who are you?"
  "What can you do?"
5.Exit Command: The user can say "sleep" to terminate the program.
